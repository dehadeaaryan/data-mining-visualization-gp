# Why Random Forest Regression?

- **Non-linearity & Interaction:**  
  It handles complex relationships between predictors (e.g., how starting position combines with circuit-specific factors) without requiring extensive manual feature engineering.

- **Robustness:**  
  Averaging multiple trees reduces overfitting, which is beneficial in real-world noisy data.

- **Feature Importance:**  
  The method gives insight into which predictors are most relevant, aiding further refinements.
