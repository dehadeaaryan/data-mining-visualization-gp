Data Mining and Visualization Group Project

## Group Members

- Aaryan Dehade
- Drake Do
- Aqil Dhanani

## Project Overview

This project involves selecting a real-life dataset and analyzing it using three different machine learning models. Our aim is to compare model performances through quantitative metrics, visualizations, and detailed code walkthroughs.

## Project Components

### Part I: Check-Up

- **Dataset:** `data.csv` (columns include: team_name, driver_code, driver_nationality, circuit_name, year, round, starting_position, finishing_position, laps, qualifying_mean, driver_age, driver_dnf, car_dnf)
- **Problem Definition:** Predict the finishing position of a driver in a race using historical racing data.
- **Plan:**
  - Each team member will implement one of three machine learning models with partial code:
    - A baseline model (e.g., Multiple Linear Regression)
    - A non-linear model (e.g., Polynomial Regression or Support Vector Regression)
    - An ensemble model (e.g., Random Forest Regression) that also provides feature importance insights.
- **Office Hours:** All members must attend the code check-up and demonstration session.

### Part II: Presentation

Our final presentation (minimum 10 minutes) will cover:

1. The dataset
2. The problem definition and model selections
3. Code walkthrough of the significant steps taken for each model
4. Visualizations of each model
5. Quantitative performance metrics for each model
6. A comparison among all models
7. Verdict on which model(s) perform(s) the best
8. Interpretation regarding why the best model(s) outperform the rest

*Note: Presentation time should be evenly distributed among all group members.*
