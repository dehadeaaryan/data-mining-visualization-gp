Data Mining and Visualization Group Project

## Group Members

- Aaryan Dehade
- Drake Do
- Aqil Dhanani

## Project Overview

This project involves selecting a real-life dataset and analyzing it using three different machine learning models. Our aim is to compare model performances through quantitative metrics, visualizations, and detailed code walkthroughs.

## Problem Statement

Predict the finishing position of a driver in a race using historical performance and race data. The model will use features like starting position, qualifying performance, driver age, number of laps, race year, and round number as inputs. Random Forest Regression is chosen because it can effectively capture nonlinear relationships and interactions among variables, thereby providing robust predictions and insight into which factors most influence the finishing position.

## Project Components

### Part I: Check-Up

- **Dataset:** To be selected.
- **Problem Definition:** To be defined.
- **Plan:** Identify and implement three specific machine learning models (one per member) with partial code for each.
- **Office Hours:** All members must attend for code check-up and demonstration.

### Part II: Presentation

Our final presentation (minimum 10 minutes) will cover:

1. The dataset
2. The problem definition and model selections
3. Code walkthrough of the significant steps taken for each model
4. Visualizations of each model
5. Quantitative performance metrics for each model
6. A comparison among all models
7. Verdict on which model(s) perform(s) the best
8. Interpretation regarding why the best model(s) outperform the rest

*Note: Presentation time should be evenly distributed among all group members.*
